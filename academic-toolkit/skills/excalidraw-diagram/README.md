# Excalidraw Diagram Skill

A coding agent skill that generates beautiful and practical Excalidraw diagrams from natural language descriptions. Not just boxes-and-arrows - diagrams that **argue visually**.

Compatible with any coding agent that supports skills. In this repo (academic-toolkit) the skill is used in-place from `skills/excalidraw-diagram/` via the repo's driving protocol — no host installation step.

## What Makes This Different

- **Diagrams that argue, not display.** Every shape/group of shapes mirrors the concept it represents — fan-outs for one-to-many, timelines for sequences, convergence for aggregation. No uniform card grids.
- **Evidence artifacts.** As an example, technical diagrams include real code snippets and actual JSON payloads.
- **Built-in visual validation.** A Playwright-based render pipeline lets the agent see its own output, catch layout issues (overlapping text, misaligned arrows, unbalanced spacing), and fix them in a loop before delivering.
- **Brand-customizable.** All colors and brand styles live in a single file (`references/color-palette.md`). Swap it out and every diagram follows your palette.

## Installation

No installation is needed inside academic-toolkit: the skill already lives at
`skills/excalidraw-diagram/` and is discovered by the repo's driving protocol.
(Standalone users of the upstream repo may copy it into their agent's skill directory.)

## Setup

The skill includes a render pipeline that lets the agent visually validate its diagrams. There are two ways to set it up:

**Option A: Ask your coding agent (easiest)**

Just tell your agent: *"Set up the Excalidraw diagram skill renderer by following the instructions in SKILL.md."* It will run the commands for you.

**Option B: Manual**

```bash
cd <repo>/skills/excalidraw-diagram/references
uv sync
uv run playwright install chromium
```

## Usage

Ask your coding agent to create a diagram:

> "Create an Excalidraw diagram showing how the AG-UI protocol streams events from an AI agent to a frontend UI"

The skill handles the rest — concept mapping, layout, JSON generation, rendering, and visual validation.

## Customize Colors

Edit `references/color-palette.md` to match your brand. Everything else in the skill is universal design methodology.
