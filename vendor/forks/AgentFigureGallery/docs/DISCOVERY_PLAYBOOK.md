# Discovery Playbook

Goal: make AgentFigureGallery easy to find, understand, try, and share.

## Positioning

```text
Teach your plotting agent Nature, Cell, and Science figure taste in one minute.
```

```text
Clone once, run one command, and your coding agent learns to query a human-curated scientific figure gallery before writing plotting code.
```

## Share Copy

```text
I built AgentFigureGallery: a human-preference memory loop for scientific plotting agents.

Instead of asking an AI agent to invent a Nature/Cell/Science-style figure from text, it first looks at real visual references, lets the human like/reject/select, then writes code from the selected bundle.

16k+ public scientific figure candidates.
Dynamic browser gallery.
One-command bootstrap plus Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor rule install.
Global and plot-type preference memory.

## First Channels

- GitHub README and topics
- Hugging Face dataset card
- `r/bioinformatics`
- `r/datascience`
- `r/MachineLearning`
- X / LinkedIn with the demo GIF
- Awesome lists for scientific visualization, bioinformatics, LLM agents, matplotlib, and ggplot2

## GitHub Metadata

- Description: `Drop-in scientific plotting skill for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other coding agents.`
- Homepage: `https://huggingface.co/datasets/dsadd4/AgentFigureGallery`
- Topics: keep `agent-tools`, `ai-agent`, `agent-skill`, `skill`, `codex`, `claude-code`, `cursor`, `llm-agents`, `human-in-the-loop`, `plotting-agent`, `scientific-figures`, `scientific-visualization`, `data-visualization`, `bioinformatics`, `matplotlib`, `ggplot2`, `reference-gallery`, `nature-style`, `cell-style`, `science-style`.
- Social preview: upload `docs/assets/agentfiguregallery-social-preview.png` in GitHub repository settings. GitHub recommends at least 640 x 320 px, with 1280 x 640 px for best display.

## Roadmap Issues To Keep Open

- [Expand curated Cell and Science style reference packs](https://github.com/Dsadd4/AgentFigureGallery/issues/3).
- [Add a faster full-public mirror for China and restricted networks](https://github.com/Dsadd4/AgentFigureGallery/issues/4).

## Completed Proof Points

- [One-command Codex skill install](https://github.com/Dsadd4/AgentFigureGallery/issues/1).
- [Generated embedding plot from a reference bundle](../examples/generated_embedding_plot/README.md).

## Launch Checklist

- README shows the GIF above installation.
- README makes the `curl ... install.sh | bash` bootstrap and `first-run --open` path visible above detailed setup.
- `agentfiguregallery doctor` passes after install.
- `agentfiguregallery first-run --open` creates a starter session and opens the local gallery.
- Hugging Face Space is live and linked from the README.
- Hugging Face dataset card is synced.
- GitHub Actions is green.
- One end-to-end example is linked from the README.
- Issue templates and PR template are available for contributors.
